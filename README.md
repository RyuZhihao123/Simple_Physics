This system is devised for simulating the `collision detection`. 

We knew that, the most complicated collision approaches provided by existing engines, are not exactly the `real` collision !!!! For example, in Unity platform, the mesh Colliders that are marked as 'Convex' can collide with other Mesh Colliders.
